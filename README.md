- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m YiÄŸit Ali Demir, a tech enthusiast and DevOps Consultant based in Cebu, Philippines. With over 17 years of experience in the tech industry, Iâ€™ve evolved from a PHP programmer (2006) to a Sysadmin (2011), and later delved into IoT development (2017) with a focus on Embedded Linux, Python, and Deep Learning. Since 2020, Iâ€™ve been thriving as a DevOps Consultant, helping teams streamline their workflows and infrastructure.
Beyond tech, Iâ€™m passionate about embedded electronics, RC hobbies (especially Crawlers and Drones), playing the piano, and exploring the outdoors through camping.
